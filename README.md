```
3. list of stocks&bonds
4. day gain&total gain
5. user profile


## üöÄGet started

## üèóÔ∏è Process (Software Development Life Cycle) 
Agile Framework: Everyone knows what's going on; Chcek our work as we are doing it; Adjust to right direction.

Daily routine
10 minutes daily stand-up at 10:00, a brief sprint review&retropective meeting at 12:30 and 17:30 to increase speed and transparency


Day 1.
split to front-end repo, back-end repo
front-end: file structure (html, assests(css,js, img)), boostrap
back-end: 3-tier architecture (controller, services, mapper)
data-eng: data sourse (Finhub API)

Day 2.
low-fidelity prototype

API design and implementation (reach a consensus)

set up a gitproject, one place to collect all documents

## ‚ú® Live Demo
https://github.com/YuezhenQin/financial-portfolio-backend/blob/main/deploy.sh

## Challenge
1. 
2. state management without framework

## What we do well
1. modular mindset (two repos, individual assets/components to resolve conflict)
2. API design first, then implementation
3. Well-maintained Documentation in Github Project
4. Good Day Routine
5. Unit Tests
6. Frequent communication
7. CICD pipeline by shell script

## What can we do better
1. lack of definition of done (DoD)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏èlack of bounds checking (valid date, valid user input, int lowbound, upbound)
3. api query limit
4. ‚ö†Ô∏èNo frontend framwork is used (no state management, no router)
5. create a user profile page
